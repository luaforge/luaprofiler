   LuaProfiler is a time profiler designed to help finding bottlenecks on your Lua program.
    If you use LuaProfiler into your program, it will generate a log of all your function calls
 and their respective running times. You can use this log to generate a summary of the functions
 your program uses, along with how long it stayed in each of them, or you can import the log into
 a spreadsheet for further analysis.
