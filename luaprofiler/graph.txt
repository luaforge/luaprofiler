About the graph:

	The graph can visually present you to the bottlenecks to the design of your
	program. It tells what functions are slow and when they are slow.

	A box represents a function.
	A line represents a call point.

	The intensity of a line or box is related to the time consumed.
	The thickness of a line or box is related to the number of executions.

	The graph starts with all modules folded. This means that you should unfold them
	in order to see their functions. To do that, choose a module that is outside the
	"legend" box, press the "i" key and click on that module to see instructions. To
	dismiss, right click.

	When you want to now the times of a function, press the key "i" and left-click on
	that function.
